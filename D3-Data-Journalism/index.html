          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty Rate and Obesity Rate</h2>
          <p>New data suggests there is a correlation between poverty rate and obesity rates in the United States and
            Washington DC. The chart above, consisting of 2015 CDC data, shows a positive correlation, meaning as the poverty
            rate (along the x or horizontal axis) increases, the obesity rate (along the y or vertical axis) also increases.
            ***Please note we are not suggesting causation in this chart, merely identifying correlation.
          </p>

          <p>Outside of a few exceptions (New Mexico and Washington DC - higher poverty rates/lower obesity rates), the trend
            is pretty clear. There are undoubtedly many underlying causes that factor into this relationship, one that jumps
            to mind is access to healthy food. Areas with higher poverty rates are more likely to live in places that are
            identified as "food deserts" which means limited access to grocery stores that stock more fresh foods as opposed to
            processed or packaged foods. The map below shows where those areas are most heavily located in the US.

          <p>As noted above, the relationship between poverty rate and obesity rate is correlative and not causative. Despite
            the caveat, decreasing a state's poverty rate is likely to increase the population's spending power. One of the
            reason's for food deserts is that there is not enough incentive for a grocery chain to be located in an area with
            high poverty. If poverty is decreased, there would likely be greater incentive for healthier food to make its way
            into those areas, which could then have an impact on the obesity rate.
